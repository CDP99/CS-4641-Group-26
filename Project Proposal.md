## CS 4641 - Predictive Stock Machine Learning Project Proposal
#### Fletcher Wells, Javier Arevalo, Matthew Nilsen, Cedric de Pierrefeu

### Abstract
We want to use different technical and fundamental stock metrics to create a regression model to try and estimate the 1yr, 3yr, and/or 5yr growth of a stock. Typically, people only use technical indicators in their models. However, we feel that using fundamental indicators like RoE, RoIC, etc. can add to the model’s ability to classify growth, since these numbers are found in company’s financial statements and have a substantive meaning to the company’s performance. We expect that we will be able to estimate at least whether a company will grow or shrink in value; we aren’t sure how accurately we will be able to estimate a company’s stock price growth percentage.

### Introduction/Background
Since the late 1980s various world renowned researchers, institutions, hedge funds, and banks have investigated the task of how to use data mining and machine learning to increase profitability in the stock market. This is one of the most research ML areas and various newer research papers have considered novel input to the predictive models such as a company’s relevant tweets (NLP), technical indicators, environmental indicators, among many others. 

The reason why this problem is so important and crucial is because of the numbers game. Even if a model beats the market by a small percentage, given a sufficiently large amount of money this model(s) can become extremely profitable business (IB, HedgeFunds, etc.) Many of the work that has been done previously is not publicly available, because of the highly profitable nature of such models and algorithms. The research papers that are available (mostly on Sentiment Analysis on the stock market).
