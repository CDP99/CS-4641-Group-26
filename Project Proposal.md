### Abstract
We want to use different technical and fundamental stock metrics to create a regression model to try and estimate the 1yr, 3yr, and/or 5yr growth of a stock. Typically, people only use technical indicators in their models. However, we feel that using fundamental indicators like RoE, RoIC, etc. can add to the model’s ability to classify growth, since these numbers are found in company’s financial statements and have a substantive meaning to the company’s performance. We expect that we will be able to estimate at least whether a company will grow or shrink in value; we aren’t sure how accurately we will be able to estimate a company’s stock price growth percentage.
